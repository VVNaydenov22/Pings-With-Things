    <p>This is a website dedicated to everything about robots.</p>
    <h3>What is a robot?</h3>
    <h4>A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer—capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically.A robot can be guided by an external control device, or the control may be embedded within. Robots may be constructed to evoke human form, but most robots are task-performing machines, designed with an emphasis on stark functionality, rather than expressive aesthetics.</h4>
    <h4>The word robot can refer to both physical robots and virtual software agents, but the latter are usually referred to as bots. There is no consensus on which machines qualify as robots but there is general agreement among experts, and the public, that robots tend to possess some or all of the following abilities and functions: accept electronic programming, process data or physical perceptions electronically, operate autonomously to some degree, move around, operate physical parts of itself or physical processes, sense and manipulate their environment, and exhibit intelligent behavior, especially behavior which mimics humans or other animals. Related to the concept of a robot is the field of synthetic biology, which studies entities whose nature is more comparable to living things than to machines.</h4>
